# dotfiles

The repository for all my dotfiles. To set this up properly, you will need to clone the repo and then copy the `.git` folder into your home directory. Then set the following `git` setting:

`git config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no`

This will prevent `git` from tracking existing files unless they are explicitly added.
